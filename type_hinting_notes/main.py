# # Generics https://medium.com/@steveYeah/using-generics-in-python-99010e5056eb
# If you are using type hints in Python and static analysis tools such
# as mypy, then you have probably used the Any type quite often to
# get around typing functions and methods where the type of an
# argument can vary at runtime. While Any itself is a very convenient
# tool that enables gradual typing in Python code (the ability to add
# type hints to your code little by little over time), it doesnâ€™t add any real value in terms of portraying
# knowledge to the reader. This is where generics come in.
